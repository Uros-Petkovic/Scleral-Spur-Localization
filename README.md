Dataset was downloaded from Grand Challenge Site for competition "Angle Closure Glaucoma Evaluation Challenge"

Project main you can look for [individual photos](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Scleral-Spur-Localization/blob/main/main_individual_photos.py) and [all photos](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Scleral-Spur-Localization/blob/main/main_all_photos.py).

Also look for my paper for details of implementation [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Scleral-Spur-Localization/blob/main/Scleral%20spur%20localization.pdf).
